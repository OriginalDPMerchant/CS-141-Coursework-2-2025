## 📋 Description

This repository contains my coursework submission for the module *CS141 - Functional Programming*. The project focuses on **implementing parsers** and **writing a complete application using haskell**.

## 🗂️ Contents

- `report.pdf` — Coursework report in PDF format. This is a general explanation of my code
- `assignment.pdf` —  The brief given for the assignment by the lecturer
- `feedback.pdf` —  The feedback given to me by my lecturer
- `code/` — Source code for the project    
- `README.md` — Project overview (this file)

## 🚀 Features / Objectives

- ✅ **Terminal UI for the user to interact with**
- ✅ **Loading and validating Gridlock save files**  
- ✅ **Allowing the user to play Gridlock games**  
- ✅ **Allowing the user to save Gridlock games to a file**
- ✅ **Error Handling and Retry Logic**

## 🏗️ Building

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Follow the instructions for installing ghcup [on the Haskell.org website](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Answer A
then Y then Y to the three prompts.

- If you are using VSCode, install the haskell extension after installing ghcup and it
will automatically initialise the toolchain once you open a Haskell file in a properlyconfigured project folder. If not using VSCode, please install ghc version 9.4.8;
and stack and cabal recommended versions according to ghcup.

### 🏃‍♂ Running

- Navigate to the `code\` directory and execute the command `stack run`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **Haskell**  
- Tools: **VS Code, Haskell Language Server, Glasgow Haskell Compiler, Stack (Haskell build tool)**  
- Libraries: **Brick (Terminal UI), Megaparsec (Parsing Game Files)**
